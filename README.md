# Rest Reminder for macOS

Rest Reminder is a simple macOS application that periodically reminds you to take a break from your computer. It features a customizable reminder interval, break duration, and a visually appealing pop-up window.

## Features

-   **Customizable Reminder Interval**: Set how often you want to be reminded to take a break.
-   **Customizable Break Duration**: Define how long the break reminder window stays on screen.
-   **Skip Reminders**: Skip the next one or two reminders.
-   **Floating Reminder Window**: A pop-up window appears on top of all other applications.
-   **Dynamic Window Sizing**: The reminder window automatically scales to 70% of your screen's visible area.
-   **Random Background Colors**: Each reminder window features a random background color with adaptive text color for readability.
-   **Countdown Timer & Progress Bar**: A 60-second countdown with a visual progress bar indicates when the window will close.
-   **Dismiss Button**: Manually close the reminder window at any time.
-   **Menu Bar Integration**: Runs as a background application with a leaf icon in the menu bar for easy access to preferences and quitting the app.

## How to Build

To build the application from source, you need Xcode Command Line Tools installed.

```bash
./build.sh
```
This will compile the Swift source files and create the `RestReminder.app` application bundle inside the `build/` directory.

## How to Run

After building the application, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
open build/RestReminder.app
```

The application will start in the background, and a leaf icon will appear in your macOS menu bar.

## Preferences

Click the leaf icon in the menu bar and select "Preferences..." to open the settings window. Here you can adjust:

-   **Reminder Interval**: How often the reminder window pops up (in minutes).
-   **Break Duration**: How long the reminder window stays on screen (in seconds).

Your settings will be saved automatically.

## Skip Reminders

Click the leaf icon in the menu bar and select "Skip Reminder" to skip the next one or two reminders.

## How to Create a DMG Installer

To create a `.dmg` installer for easy distribution, use the provided `create_dmg.sh` script.

1.  **Ensure the application is built** (run `./build.sh` first).

2.  **Run the DMG creation script**:
    ```bash
    ./create_dmg.sh
    ```
    This will generate a `RestReminder.dmg` file in the current directory.

## Notes

-   The application's main icon (in Finder or Launchpad) is the default macOS application icon. Customizing this requires generating an `.icns` file and updating `Info.plist` accordingly.
-   Features like "Launch at Login", "Pause Timer When System is Idle", and "Disable Reminders During Do Not Disturb" were explored but not fully implemented due to complexities in a CLI-built environment (e.g., requiring specific entitlements or deeper system integrations).
-   This project was generated by Gemini CLI.
